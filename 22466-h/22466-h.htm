<h1>The<br />
<span class="smcap">Ultimate<br />
Experiment</span></h1>


<h2>by<br />
THORNTON DeKY</h2>



<p class="center"><i>No living soul breathed upon the<br />
earth. Only robots, carrying on the<br />
last great order.</i></p>


<p class="cap">"THEY were all gone
now, The Masters, all
dead and their atoms scattered to
the never ceasing winds that swept
the great crysolite city towers in
ever increasing fury. That had been
the last wish of each as he had
passed away, dying from sheer old
age. True they had fought on as
long as they could to save their
kind from utter extinction but the
comet that had trailed its poisoning
wake across space to leave behind it,
upon Earth, a noxious, lethal gas
vapor, had done its work too well."</p>

<p>No living soul breathed upon the
Earth. No one lived here now, but
Kiron and his kind.</p>

<p>"And," so thought Kiron to himself,
"he might as well be a great unthinking
robot able to do only one
thing instead of the mental giant he
was, so obsessed had he become with
the task he had set himself to do."</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of a great loneliness
and a strong fear of a final frustration,
he worked on with the others of
his people, hardly stopping for anything
except the very necessities needed
to keep his big body working in perfect
coordination.</p>

<p>Tirelessly he worked, for The Masters
had bred, if that is the word to
use, fatigue and the need for restoration
out of his race long decades ago.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, he would stop
his work when the great red dying
sun began to fade into the west and
his round eyes would grow wistful as
he looked out over the great city that
stretched in towering minarets and
lofty spires of purest crystal blue for
miles on every side. A fairy city of
rarest hue and beauty. A city for the
Gods and the Gods were dead. Kiron
felt, at such times, the great loneliness
that the last Master must have known.</p>

<p>They had been kind, The Masters,
and Kiron knew that his people, as
they went about their eternal tasks
of keeping the great city in perfect
shape for The Masters who no longer
needed it, must miss them as he did.</p>

<p>Never to hear their voices ringing,
never to see them again gathered in
groups to witness some game or to
play amid the silver fountains and
flowery gardens of the wondrous city,
made him infinitely saddened. It would
always be like this, unless....</p>

<p>But thinking, dreaming, reminiscing
would not bring it all back for there
was only one answer to still the longing:
work. The others worked and did
not dream, but instead kept busy tending
to the thousand and one tasks The
Masters had set them to do&mdash;had left
them doing when the last Master
perished. He too must remember the
trust they had placed in his hands
and fulfill it as best he could.</p>

<p>From the time the great red eye of
the sun opened itself in the East until
it disappeared in the blue haze beyond
the crysolite city, Kiron labored with
his fellows. Then, at the appointed
hour, the musical signals would peal
forth their sweet, sad chimes, whispering
goodnight to ears that would
hear them no more and all operations
would halt for the night, just as it had
done when The Masters were here to
supervise it.</p>

<p>Then when morning came he would
start once more trying, testing, experimenting
with his chemicals and
plastics, forever following labyrinth
of knowledge, seeking for the great
triumph that would make the work
of the others of some real use.</p>

<p>His hands molded the materials
carefully, lovingly to a pattern that
was set in his mind as a thing to
cherish. Day by day his experiments
in their liquid baths took form under
his careful modeling. He mixed his
chemicals with the same loving touch,
the same careful concentration and
painstaking thoroughness, studying
often his notes and analysis charts.</p>

<p>Everything must be just so lest his
experiment not turn out perfectly. He
never became exasperated at a failure
or a defect that proved to be the only
reward for his faithful endeavors but
worked patiently on toward a goal
that he knew would ultimately be his.</p>

<p>Then one day, as the great red sun
glowed like an immense red eye overhead,
Kiron stepped back to admire
his handiwork. In that instant the
entire wondrous city seemed to
breathe a silent prayer as he stood
transfixed by the sight before him.
Then it went on as usual, hurrying
noiselessly about its business. The surface
cars, empty though they were,
fled swiftly about supported only by
the rings of magnetic force that held
them to their designated paths. The
gravoships raised from the tower-dromes
to speed silently into the eye
of the red sun that was dying.</p>

<p>"No one now," Kiron thought to
himself as he studied his handiwork.
Then he walked unhurriedly to the
cabinet in the laboratory corner and
took from it a pair of earphones resembling
those of a long forgotten
radio set. Just as unhurriedly, though
his mind was filled with turmoil and
his being with excitement, he walked
back and connected the earphones to
the box upon his bench. The phones
dangled into the liquid bath before
him as he adjusted them to suit his
requirements.</p>

<p>Slowly he checked over every step
of his experiments before he went
farther. Then, as he proved them for
the last time, his hand went slowly
to the small knife switch upon the box
at his elbow. Next he threw into connection
the larger switch upon his
laboratory wall bringing into his laboratory
the broadcast power of the
crysolite city.</p>

<p>The laboratory generators hummed
softly, drowning out the quiet hum
of the city outside. As they built up,
sending tiny living electrical impulses
over the wires like minute currents
that come from the brain, Kiron sat
breathless; his eyes intent.</p>

<p>Closer to his work he bent, watching
lovingly, fearful least all might
not be quite right. Then his eyes took
on a brighter light as he began to see
the reaction. He knew the messages
that he had sent out were being received
and coordinated into a unit that
would stir and grow into intellect.</p>

<p>Suddenly the machine flashed its
little warning red light and automatically
snapped off. Kiron twisted
quickly in his seat and threw home
the final switch. This, he knew, was
the ultimate test. On the results of the
flood of energy impulses that he had
set in motion rested the fulfillment of
his success&mdash;<i>or failure</i>.</p>

<p>He watched with slight misgivings.
This had never been accomplished before.
How could it possibly be a success
now? Even The Masters had
never quite succeeded at this final
test, how could he, only a servant? Yet
it must work for he had no desire in
life but to make it work.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he was on his feet,
eyes wide. From the two long, coffin-like
liquid baths, there arose two perfect
specimens of the <i>Homo sapiens</i>.
Man and woman, they were, and they
blinked their eyes in the light of the
noonday sun, raised themselves dripping
from the baths of their creation
and stepped to the floor before Kiron.</p>

<p>The man spoke, the woman remained
silent.</p>

<p>"I am Adam Two," he said. "Created,
by you Kiron from a formula
they left, in their image. I was created
to be a Master and she whom you
also have created is to be my wife.
We shall mate and the race of Man
shall be reborn through us and others
whom I shall help you create."</p>

<p>The Man halted at the last declaration
he intoned and walked smilingly
toward the woman who stepped into
his open arms returning his smile.</p>

<p>Kiron smiled too within his pumping
heart. The words the Man had intoned
had been placed in his still
pregnable mind by the tele-teach
phones and record that the last Master
had prepared before death had halted
his experiments. The actions of the
Man toward the Woman, Kiron knew,
was caused by the natural constituents
that went to form his chemical
body and govern his humanness.</p>

<p>He, Kiron, had created a living man
and woman. The Masters lived again
because of him. They would sing and
play and again people the magnificent
crysolite city because he loved
them and had kept on until success
had been his. But then why not such
a turnabout? Hadn't they, The Masters,
created him a superb, thinking
<i>robot</i>?</p>
